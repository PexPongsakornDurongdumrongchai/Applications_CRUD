# Applications_CRUD

Make a CRUD (Create Update Read Delete) project, where we can manage software license

The data needed to keep the license records is
1. Company name
2. Full name (of user)
3. Job title (of user)
4. email address (of user)
5. Software username
6. Expiration Date (for the license)
7. Version (of the software)

Technical requirement
1. The CRUD must be done using Django framework in the backend
2. It is a single database table but can be expanded into more database tables.
3. Pythonical good practices are well appreciated (good practices using the latest Python version) and documentation of the code
4. The front end is free, the main focus of this assessment is the backend but it must follow the CRUD rules.
